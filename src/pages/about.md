Hey! I'm Phillip. Welcome to my website.

I'm a software developer with a majority of my experience in QA automation roles. I got my start in manufacturing at a Fortune 500 company but have spent the last five years working at startups. Most recently, I worked as an SDET at FloQast where I helped increase test coverage for the company's cloud storage and ERP integrations which were hosted on AWS Lambdas. I have a wide range of experience creating API, UI, contract and integration tests. As for technologies I'm  familiar with, I'm most comfortable coding in Java and Javascript but have written lots of C# and Python in the past. I'm also familiar with MySQL as well as NoSQL databases like MongoDB.

In my free time, I enjoy watching baseball, speedcubing, and playing video games. If you have any questions, feel free to [reach out.](mailto:phillip@phillipmclaurin.com) I look forward to hearing from you!
